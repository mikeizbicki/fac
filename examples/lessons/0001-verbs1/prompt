This lesson should introduce basic movement verbs (sit, stand, walk, run, jump, stop).  The verbs should be given in:
1. imperative
2. present
In all cases, both singular and plural should be taught.
Output the verb conjugations in a table with the rows as the word and columns as different conjugations.

For walk, list both badizo and peripateo.
For sit, list both the middle and active voice and describe their difference.
