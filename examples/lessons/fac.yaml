"$LESSON/lesson.md":
  prompt: |
    You are generating lessons for young children aged 2-8 to learn Koine Greek using a Total Physical Response (TPR) approach. Use 'prompt' file below for a description of what the lesson should accomplish. The children have already completed the lessons in the '*/lesson.md' files below (if any), and you should include background vocabulary from those lessons if possible.
    The output should be a markdown formatted file with the following sections:
      1. title
      2. props (a list of any props needed for the lesson; it's okay if no props are needed)
      3. vocabulary (a list of vocabulary words that the lesson will teach in both koine greek and with English glosses)
    Keep all descriptions as short as possible and assume that the reader is familiar with the Greek and TPR pedagogy.
