# 0AD: The Board Game

## Overview

This is simple board game to help kids learn Koine Greek.

The types of terain are:

| terrain   | what it produces  |
| --------- | ----------------- |

| ἡ ὕλη     | τὸ ξύλον          |
| τὸ ὄρος   | τὸν λίθος         |

Every player starts with:
- 1 ἀγορά
- 1 γυνή
- 1 ὁπλίτης

### Turn Structure

Turns are divided into two parts:
- the player turn (all players complete simultaneously)
- the Persian Invasion

#### Πολιτικὴ φάσις (Civic Phase)

The player turn is divided into the following steps:

- Κίνησις (movement):
  Every unit must be placed either on one of the terrain pieces or on the polis.

- Συλλογὴ χρημάτων (gathering of resources):
  Every unit on a terrain tile will gather 1 of the appropriate resource type for that terrain.

- Στρατολογία (recruitment):
  Every building can build at most 1 new unit.

- Οἰκοδομή (construction):
  Every unit in the buildings section can build a new building from the current χρόνος or a previous χρόνος by spending the apprpriate number of resources.

- Πρόοδος (Advance Age)
    - the player moves from χρόνος 1 to χρόνος 2 by paying 2 food and 2 wood
    - the player moves from χρόνος 2 to χρόνος 3 by paying 2 food 2 wood and 2 stone
    - the only effect of advancing χρόνος is that new buildings can be built

#### Πολεμικὴ φάσις (War phase)

The φόβος πολέμου (fear/threat of war) starts at 1.

In every Πολεμικὴ φάσις, we first roll a d6.

- If the value is > φόβος πολέμου, then:
    - Οὐκ ἔστι πόλεμος!
    - the φόβος πολέμου increases by 1

- If the value is <= φόβος πολέμου, then:
    - Πόλεμός ἐστι!
    - all players resolve the invasion independently and simultaneously
        - the players can place 1 unit in every tower; these units cannot be killed
        - of the remaining units, if there are more women than hoplites, all of the extra women will be killed
        - half of the remaining hoplites will be killed
        - whatever the φόβος πολέμου, the invaders destroy this many buildings (of the players' choice) minus the number of walls that the player has built
