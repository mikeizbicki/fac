     7	### Setup
       
     8	Every player is given 1 of each τύπος τέρας tile.
     9	The types of τύπος τέρας are:
       
    10	| τύπος τέρας   | what it produces  |
    11	| --------- | ----------------- |
    12	| ἡ ἀγρός     | τρόφη              |
    13	| ἡ ὕλη       | τὸ ξύλον              |
    14	| τὸ ὄρος      | ὁ λίθος             |
       
    15	Every player starts with:
    16	- 1 ἡ ἀγορά
    17	- 1 ἡ γυνή
    18	- 1 ὁ ὁπλίτης
       
    19	### Turn Structure
       
    20	Turns are divided into two parts:
    21	- the player turn (all players complete simultaneously)
    22	- the Persian Invasion
       
    23	#### Ἡ Πολιτικὴ φάσις (Civic Phase)
       
    24	The player turn is divided into the following steps:
       
    25	- ἡ Κίνησις (movement):
    26	  Every unit must be placed either on one of the τύπος τέρας pieces or on the πόλις.
       
    27	- ἡ Συλλογὴ χρημάτων (gathering of resources):
    28	  Every unit on a τύπος τέρας tile will gather 1 of the appropriate resource type for that τύπος τέρας.
       
    29	- ἡ Στρατολογία (recruitment):
    30	  Every building can build at most 1 new unit.
       
    31	- ἡ Οἰκοδομή (construction):
    32	  Every unit in the buildings section can build a new building from the current ὁ χρόνος or a previous ὁ chóng by spending the apprpriate number of resources.
       
    33	- ἡ Πρόοδος (Advance Age)
    34	    - the player moves from ὁ χρόνος 1 to ὁ χρόνος 2 by paying 2 food and 2 wood
    35	    - the player moves from ὁ χρόνος 2 to ὁ χρόνος 3 by paying 2 food 2 wood and 2 stone
    36	    - the only effect of advancing ὁ χρόνος is that new buildings can be built
       
    37	#### Ἡ Πολεμικὴ φάσις (War phase)
       
    38	The ὁ φόβος πολέμου (fear/threat of war) starts at 1.
       
    39	In every Πολεμικὴ φάσις, we first roll a d6.
       
    40	- If the value is > ὁ φόβος πολέμου, then:
    41	    - Οὐκ ἔστι πόλεμος!
    42	    - ὁ φόβος πολέμου increases by 1
       
    43	- If the value is <= ὁ φόβος πολέμου, then:
    44	    - Πόλεμός ἐστι!
    45	    - all players resolve the invasion independently and simultaneously
    46	        - the players can place 1 unit in every τὸ τεῖχος; these units cannot be killed
    47	        - of the remaining units, if there are more γυναῖκες than ὁπλῖται, all of the extra γυναῖκες will be killed
    48	        - half of the remaining ὁπλῖται will be killed
    49	        - whatever ὁ φόβος πολέμου, the invaders destroy this many buildings (of the players' choice) minus the number of τείχη that the player has built
