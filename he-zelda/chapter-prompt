The output should have the following sections:

## Story

The story should be divided into multiple small sections using markdown.
Each section should:
1. Have a title in the target language.
2. Begin with a markdown image.  The alt-text should describe what happens in the section in English.  The img url should be sectionXXX.png, where XXX is the section number.
3. The story should contain 10-30 words in the target language.

## Vocabulary

Should contain a markdown table of newly introduced words and english glosses; only provide roots, not all used forms.
The table should be broken up into different sections for different parts of speech.
Even grammarish words should be included.
All words should contain appropriate diacritics (e.g. accents and niqqud) to aide learning.

Whenever possible:
1. Introduce a word and its opposite in the same story; use repetition to illustrate that the words are opposites
2. Introduce etymologically related words in the same story, and use repetition to illustrate the relationship

## Grammar

Should contain a list of short English descriptions of which grammar is introduced in the chapter.
These items should not be detailed enough for learning, but only detailed enough so that a knowledgable teacher can skim the content to see what concepts are introduced in the chapter.

IMPORTANT:
You should minimize the new grammar introduced,
and only intoduce a new concept if it is absolutely required for the story.
