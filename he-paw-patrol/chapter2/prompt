This chapter should introduce the verbs for opening and closing a door and the adjectives for having the door opened and closed.
You should introduce the infinitive and imperative paal forms, but not introduce other forms (like piel / hiphil or other tensense like future tense; ALL VERBS MUST BE PAAL).

The plot is:
Farmer Yumi has three animals: a cow, a horse, and a pig.
Farmer Yumi is teaching a boy Danny how to care for the animals by putting them into their pens.
After Farmer Yumi leaves, Danny is distracted and forgets to close the farm door.
The animals escape and go to interesting places out in town.
Danny calls Ryder for help getting the animals back into the barn.
