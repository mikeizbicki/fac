The purpose of this project is to teach young children 2-7 years old basic Koine Greek.
The end result will be a book that parents can read to children.
Each page of the book will have a picture and a short description of the picture.
The description should be written in Koine and be designed to teach a key vocabulary or grammar concept.
Many descriptions will have only a single word on the page.
No description will be longer than 2 sentences,
and all sentences will use simple grammar.

For vocabulary/grammar:
1. focus on Koine dialect (as used in the New Testament), rather than Attic or other dialects
2. focus on words that have English or Spanish cognates.
3. use lots of repetition, and use words that will be easy to understand in context from the pictures; ensure that the vocab/grammar is repeated from previous chapters

All greek should be written with diacritics.
