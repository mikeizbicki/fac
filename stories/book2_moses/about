The purpose of this story is to make the biblical story of Moses saving the Israelites from Pharoah accessible to young children.
The plot is that there is a family of children (who represent Moses) and they are being oppressed by Bowser (who represents pharoah) and his koopas.
The story begins with the children being oppressed by bowser and using their animorph powers to escape;
then they hear god telling them to go back and free the other children;
the plagues are replaced with things that would be funny for young children instead of scary (but the new plagues are still obviously bad).
