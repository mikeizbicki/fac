      "description": "The mouth of the mountain cave opens wide, with smooth stone walls worn by centuries of wind and weather. Shafts of golden sunlight pierce through the opening, creating dramatic patterns of light and shadow on the sandy floor inside. The entrance is large enough for children to enter easily, with scattered rocks and desert plants growing near the opening."

      "name": "Deep Cave",
      "description": "Deep within the rocky cavern, the walls curve upward into darkness, carved smooth by ancient waters and wind. Thin beams of light filter down through cracks in the ceiling high above, illuminating patches of fine sand on the cave floor. The air is cool and still, creating an atmosphere of mystery and reverence."

      "name": "Cave Floor",
      "description": "The sandy floor of the cave is soft and comfortable, covered with fine desert sand that has blown in over many years. Smooth stone walls rise up on all sides, while beams of sunlight from ceiling cracks create circular patches of warm light. Small pebbles and bits of desert vegetation are scattered across the sand."
