      "description": "The central square of the Israelite village features a large stone well surrounded by simple mud-brick houses with flat roofs. Women traditionally gather here to draw water in clay vessels, while children play in the dusty streets between date palm trees that provide scattered shade. Clay pottery and weaving tools are arranged in small courtyards, and the smell of bread baking in outdoor ovens fills the warm air."

      "name": "House Interior",
      "description": "Inside one of the mud-brick houses, the simple room has woven mats on the earthen floor and oil lamps providing flickering light. Clay jars line the walls for storing grain and water, while a low wooden table sits in the center surrounded by cushions. The thick walls keep the interior cool, and small windows allow gentle breezes to flow through the dwelling."
    },
    {
      "name": "Village Outskirts",
      "description": "At the edge of the village, the mud-brick houses give way to open fields where date palms grow in organized groves. The dusty paths wind between scattered olive trees and patches of grain, while the central well remains visible in the distance. Here the sounds of the village are softer, and the desert wilderness can be seen on the horizon."
