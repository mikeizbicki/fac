The purpose of this story is to make the biblical story of Jonah accessible to young children.
The plot is that there is a family of children (who represent Jonah) and they must confront the evil baby darth vader and his storm troopers (who represent Ninevah).
The family of children first learn about evil darth vader when he does mean things to them (and they successfully confront him with force);
this happens several times before the children hear a message from God that they should forgive darth vader and convert him to the good side.
The story includes a discussion about how the good children feel resentful for baby darth vader's redemption,
but that god loves and forgives all people equally and the children need to come to terms with that.
The story will gradually introduce new biblical hebrew idioms.
