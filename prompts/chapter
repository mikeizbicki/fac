The output should have the following sections (##):

## Story

Divide the story into 5-20 subsections (###) using markdown.
Each subsection should:
1. Have a title in the target language (with English translation in parentheses).
2. Begin with a markdown image.
    a. The alt-text should describe what happens in the section in English.
    b. The img url should be sectionXXX.png, where XXX is the section number.
3. Contain 10-30 words in the target language.
4. Contain action that progresses the story.

## Vocabulary

Create a markdown table for each part of speech.
1. Each table should have two columns:
    1. "Word" provides the dictionary form of the word in target language.
    2. "Gloss" provides an English-language gloss
3. Only list vocabulary new to the chapter.
    DO NOT LIST VOCABULARY PREVIOUSLY USED IN ANOTHER CHAPTER.

Whenever possible:
1. Introduce a word and its opposite in the same story; use repetition to illustrate that the words are opposites
2. Introduce etymologically related words in the same story, and use repetition to illustrate the relationship.
3. Focus the new vocabulary around a single theme.

## Grammar

Create a list of 1 sentence English descriptions of the grammar introduced in the chapter.
1. The items should not be detailed enough for learning.
2. They should be useful for a teacher to skim to see what material is introduced, or for a light review of the material.

IMPORTANT:
1. You should minimize the new grammar introduced.
2. Only intoduce a new concept if it is absolutely required for the story.
3. The text of the story should still review previous grammar.
