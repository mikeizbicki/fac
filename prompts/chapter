The output should be in JSON format (do not include markdown code blocks) with the following schema:
{ "name"
, "sections": []
}

The "sections" list will contain a list of 5-20 plot sections that develop the plot.
Each section in the "sections" list should be a JSON dictionary with the following keys:
- "sublocation": this should exactly match the "name" field of one of the sublocations; it is okay to not use all of the sublocations; it is good to revisit sublocations that have already been mentioned if revisiting fits with the plot; it is okay to stay at the same sublocation for several sections in a row
- "image_description": a detailed 2-3 sentence description of how the action in the "text" field is interacting with the subscene; it should fully describe whatever actions are taking place
- "text": 10-30 words in the target language; the text of the story should advance the plot and demonstrate the vocabulary/grammar
