    2. A short list of grammar concepts to introduce.
        The grammar concepts should include increasingly complicated verb forms, sentence structure, time references, etc.
    3. There should be a vocabulary theme for each chapter
        (and the opportunity to review previous vocabulary).

    1. Be fun for small kids.
    2. Be funny.
    3. Gradually introduce more complpex vocabulary/grammar/other idioms.

5. The characters are all "shape shifters" (בְּנֵי־חַיּוֹת in Hebrew, μεταμορφούμενος in Greek, and transformator in Latin)  that are able to change from their human form into the form of their favorite animal.  They use their transformed forms in different ways throughout the story to advance the plot.
