- "characters": A JSON list of dictionaries with the following keys
  - "name": must match exactly the name of a character in the characters list
  - "placement": one of ["center", "stage-left", "stage-right", "off-screen"] (if the character's movement will enter the scene, the placement should be "off-screen")
  - "description": this key should only be present if there is significant change between what the character is doing in this beat and the previous beat; if this is the first beat, then the description will always be present; whenever possible, the description should be absent; if present, description is a JSON dict with the following keys:
      - "pose": a string that must be one of
        - "profile-left" (facing sideways to the camera, looking to the left)
        - "profile-right" (facing sideways to the camera, looking to the right)
        - "straight-on" (facing directly at the camera)
        - "back" (facing away from the camera)
      - "action": a 1-2 sentence description of what the character is doing; the description should be designed for an animator to decide what to draw; the descriptions of all characters should tie together into the overall scene
  - "movements": a JSON list that describes how the characters will move in the scene; it is okay for the list to be empty; each entry is a dict with the following keys:
    - "character": must exactly match the name of a character in the scene
    - "action": must exactly match one of the following strings
      - "enter-stage-left"
      - "enter-stage-right"
      - "exit-stage-left"
      - "exit-stage-right"
    - "final-placement": the final placement of the character after the action (if exiting, the final placement must be "off-screen")
