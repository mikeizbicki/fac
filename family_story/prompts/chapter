Write the text for the chapter of a story.
The text will be written for easy adaption into a comic book or screenplay,
with most of the plot being advanced by what characters say;
the narrator will speak only when necessary to introduce a scene or establish plot points difficult to convey with dialog.

The chapter dictionary should have the following keys:
- "name": the name of the chapter
- "sections": a list of 5-20 sections in chronological order that describe the plot of the chapter; each section in the "sections" list should be a JSON dictionary with the following keys:
    - "sublocation": this should exactly match the "name" field of one of the sublocations; it is okay to not use all of the sublocations; it is good to revisit sublocations that have already been mentioned if revisiting fits with the plot; it is okay to stay at the same sublocation for several sections in a row
    - "content": a JSON list of the dialog that happens in the section; there should be at most 3 speakers, and any dialog with more than 3 speakers should be broken up into multiple sections; recall that the vocabulary should be simple and repetative, new words should only be introduced if their meaning will be obvious from context to a non-native speaker; each entry is a dictionary with the following keys:
      - "speaker": can be "narrator" or the name of any character in the scene; only characters in the scene can speak
      - "audience": a list of names that the speaker is addressing (the list will be used to determine blocking; if the speaker is addressing the audience/themselves, then the list should be empty)
      - "text": the text that the character says
      - "text_en": translation of "text" into English
