Create a background image for animating a scene using cel animation.
The style should be cartoonish with bright colors; fun for kids.

Do not include any characters, or foreground objects that the characters might interact with (e.g. tables/chairs/boxes/bushes).
These will be added later, and having them in the background will disrupt the cel animation.
Each scene should be totally empty, but only have minimal decorations away from where the characters will interact.
There must be a clear, flat space 100px above the bottom of the picture for the characters and sprites to be placed on.
There should be no text.

scene: $LOCATION

$(jq ".[] | .sublocations[] | select(.name == \"$LOCATION\")" "$STORY/locations.json")
