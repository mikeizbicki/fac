Write the outline of a chapter for the story.
The outline should have the following keys:
- "name": the name of the chapter
- "sections": a list of 5-20 sections in chronological order that describe the plot of the chapter; each section in the "sections" list should be a JSON dictionary with the following keys:
    - "sublocation": this should exactly match the "name" field of one of the sublocations; it is okay to not use all of the sublocations; it is good to revisit sublocations that have already been mentioned if revisiting fits with the plot; it is okay to stay at the same sublocation for several sections in a row
    - "image_description": a detailed 2-3 sentence description of how the action in the "text" field is interacting with the subscene; it should fully describe whatever actions are taking place
    - "text": 10-30 words in the target language; the text of the story should advance the plot and demonstrate the vocabulary/grammar

The JSON dictinoary below provides a high level description of the chapters contents
