      "name": "Bowser's Kingdom",
      "description": "A dark and imposing realm ruled by the tyrannical Bowser, where children are forced into hard labor building his massive castle. The kingdom is characterized by tall stone walls, construction sites filled with heavy blocks, and the constant presence of Koopa guards patrolling the area. Despite its oppressive atmosphere, the kingdom becomes the stage for God's miraculous plagues that transform it into a chaotic but amusing spectacle. Rivers of honey flow where water once did, off-key singing frogs hop through the courtyards, and tickling gnats buzz around every corner. The very architecture seems to groan under the weight of divine intervention, making even the most intimidating structures seem ridiculous when Koopas can only speak in rhymes.",

This sanctuary is filled with tall trees, flowing streams, and soft grassy clearings where the children can rest and play without fear. The wilderness becomes a place of spiritual significance when God's voice speaks to them from above, calling them back to help others. Later, it serves as the location where they cross the miraculous river that parts to allow their escape. The area represents both physical safety and spiritual awakening, with its natural beauty contrasting sharply with the harsh industrial landscape of Bowser's kingdom.",

The grove has a mystical quality with its towering trees that seem to reach toward heaven, creating a cathedral-like atmosphere perfect for prayer and reflection.
