We are creating several lists of Hebrew vocabulary useful for beginners.
For each hebrew word
- write in hebrew script with niqqud
- provide no transliterations
- provide an english gloss
For each list
- provide a short description of the list
- output the list as a markdown table below the description
The lists are
- common biblical hebrew verbs and their antonymns in the same row (qal verbs only)
- common biblical hebrew nouns and their antonymns in the same row
- common biblical hebrew adjectives and their antonymns in the same row
- common biblical hebrew verbs (with synonymns in the same row)

- common biblical hebrew roots (and nouns/verbs/adjectives derived from these roots)
