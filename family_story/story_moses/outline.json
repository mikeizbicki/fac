Each time, the children ask Bowser to free everyone, but he refuses and becomes angrier. Aurelia loses her blanket during the chaos, and everyone searches for it using vocabulary from their adventures, finally finding it under a pile of bouncy balls. One of the children reads a book that gives them advice about being patient and trusting God's plan."
