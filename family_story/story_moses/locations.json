    "name": "Bowser's Castle Beach",
    "description": "A massive sandy beach dominated by Bowser's dark fortress castle that sits imposingly on a rocky cliff overlooking the shore. The castle's towers cast long shadows across the work areas where children are forced to build elaborate sand castles under the watchful eyes of koopa guards. Multiple construction zones are scattered across the beach, each marked by tools, buckets, and half-built sand structures that represent the endless labor the children must perform. The beach connects to various parts of Bowser's domain through stone pathways and wooden bridges, while guard towers positioned strategically allow the koopas to monitor all activity. This location represents the biblical theme of slavery and oppression, with the beach serving as both a place of forced labor and eventual liberation as the children must cross the waters to escape.",

    "name": "The Great River Crossing",
    "description": "A wide, flowing river that serves as the boundary between Bowser's oppressive territory and the promised land of freedom beyond.

Ancient stone markers and weathered wooden posts line both sides of the river, remnants of old boundaries and forgotten crossings. This location represents the biblical Red Sea crossing, where the children must use their shapeshifting abilities and teamwork to help everyone safely reach the other side. The river's current is strong enough to be challenging but not dangerous, creating tension without real harm to the young characters.",
