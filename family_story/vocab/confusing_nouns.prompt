Create a list of 40 Biblical Hebrew nouns that are easy to confuse.

The output should:
1. Start with a 1-2 sentence description of the words. The description should use technical linguistic terms and describe the contents of the table in a way suitable for a skilled instructor to use as a reference.
2. Have a markdown numbered list ordered from the most important words for beginners at top to the least important at the bottom.
    Each entry of the list should have two bullet points:
    - **Words**: a list of 2-4 words that are easy to confuse; these should be root words only and not conjugations of the same word
    - **Explanation**: a 1-3 sentence explanation of why these words are easy to confuse with each other; the explanations should use technical linguistic terminology suitable for a skilled instructor to use as a reference; the explanation should address concepts like morphology, phonology, etymology, or syntax.

All hebrew words should be written in Hebrew script (with niqqud, and without transliteration), and should contain an English gloss in parentheses.
