{
"words": ["אָמַר (to say)", "עָמַד (to stand)"],
"explanation": "These roots both have similar syllabic patterns and differ only in the initial guttural consonant (aleph vs. ayin), making them phonologically confusable for beginners, especially given the subtle distinction between א and ע in Biblical Hebrew speech."
},
{
"words": ["שָׁמַע (to hear)", "שָׁמַר (to keep/guard)"],
"explanation": "Both roots begin with the consonant cluster שׁ-מ, differing only by the third radical (ע vs. ר), easily causing morphological confusion, particularly in binyanim where the final consonant may be less pronounced."
},
{
"words": ["בָּנָה (to build)", "בִּין (to understand)"],
"explanation": "Phonologically similar due to the shared initial בּ and medial נ, with a difference in the type of root and vowel pattern. The roots also overlap in semantic fields regarding conceptual development."
