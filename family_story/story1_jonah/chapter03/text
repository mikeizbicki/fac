      "description": "The vast Mediterranean shoreline stretches endlessly with rolling waves crashing against weathered rocks. Ancient stones line the beach, polished smooth by countless tides, while seabirds circle overhead in the salty air. Foam and spray dance across the water's surface as waves retreat and advance in eternal rhythm. The horizon blends sea and sky into one infinite expanse that seems to call toward distant lands."

      "description": "Large weathered rocks jut from the shoreline like ancient monuments, their surfaces carved smooth by wind and water. Waves crash against these stone formations, sending spray high into the air before retreating back to the sea. Smaller stones and pebbles scatter around the base of these rocks, creating tide pools that reflect the sky. The endless horizon stretches beyond, where the great sea meets the heavens."

    {
      "name": "Sandy Beach",
      "description": "Soft sand stretches along the shoreline, marked by the patterns of retreating waves and scattered with smooth stones. Seabirds leave their tracks in the wet sand as they search for food among the tide pools. The weathered rocks of the coast provide shelter from the stronger waves, while gentle foam reaches toward the children's feet. The vast sea extends to the horizon, its surface sparkling in the sunlight."
