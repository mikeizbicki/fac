      "description": "Massive stone walls rise high into the stormy sky, their dark surfaces marked by ancient battles and weathered by countless storms. Iron gates stand closed within the walls, while guard towers loom overhead like watching eyes. The fortress represents the stronghold of evil that must be approached with courage and divine purpose. Lightning occasionally illuminates the imposing structure, revealing its formidable defenses against any who would dare approach."

      "description": "A large open courtyard spreads within the fortress walls, paved with dark stones and surrounded by towering battlements. Empty weapon racks and abandoned training equipment scatter across the space, suggesting a place where evil was once practiced. The courtyard echoes with the sounds of wind and distant thunder, creating an atmosphere of loneliness and abandonment. Stone steps lead up to the main fortress towers, while shadowy corners hide the secrets of this imposing stronghold."

      "description": "The main entrance to the fortress features heavy wooden doors bound with iron, set within an archway of dark stone. Stone steps lead up to this entrance, while the massive walls of the fortress rise on either side. Guard towers flank the entrance, their empty windows staring down like hollow eyes. The entrance represents the threshold between the outside world and the heart of enemy territory, where the children must find courage to complete their divine mission."
