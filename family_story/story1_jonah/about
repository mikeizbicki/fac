This story is a retelling of the Biblical story of Jonah in a way that is fun/accessible for children.

Plot:
1. There is a family of children (who represent Jonah) and they must confront the evil baby darth vader and his storm troopers (who represent Ninevah).
2. The family of children first learn about evil darth vader when he does mean things to them.
    1. They successfully confront him with force.
    2. This happens several times, each time baby darth vader does something worse.
3. The children hear a message from God that they should forgive darth vader and convert him to the good side.
The story includes a discussion about how the good children feel resentful for baby darth vader's redemption,
but that god loves and forgives all people equally and the children need to come to terms with that.

Language notes:
1. The story begins with VERY BASIC biblical hebrew, assuming that the audience has basically no exposure.
2. The story ends with more advanced biblical hebrew that will only be fully understood by someone who has studied a lot.
