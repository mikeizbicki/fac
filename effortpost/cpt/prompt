There is an idea in Christian pacifism about Jesus's "third way" that involves not merely being passive, but actively working to make the world a more peaceful place.
One of the main organizations behind this "third way" movement is the Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT).
Recently, CPT changed their name from Christian Peacemaker Teams to Community Peacemaker Teams.
I want to read an effortpost that explores why CPT changed their name.
